# Challenger

Challenger  - an app to help bring the next level of competition to your group.

## Project Overview

Challenger provides a way for small groups to test each other with friendly competitions based on common skill sets and interests. Whether you are teaching music lessons, coaching a soccer team or just a group of friends trying to top each other, this forum allows you to quickly set up a group, designate a master of ceremonies and define the limits. Members then can load up a video or image of their results. The master of ceremonies can privately grade submissions and peers can upvote each others' efforts. Members with a subscription service provide private links to families and fiends of their videos.

#### Typography

The target age group for this site is rather wide. Children from the ages of 13 to octogenarians could make use of the application. With that in mind, the base font size is 18px to make it easy to read. 

The purpose of the site is to allow peers to interact with friendly challenges from wherever they are geographically. Since the tasks depicted as challenges are to highlight the best skills one possesses and to try new things, a futuristic font was chosen to roughly match the feel of star trek, and encourage participants to boldly go where they haven't gone before.

Several Google Fonts were explored and only those without any lower case l's and upper case I's were chosen.
